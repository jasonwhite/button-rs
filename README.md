# Button

A low-level build system intended to be used as the back-end for something more
high-level (i.e., a meta build system or package manager).

## Non-Goals

This is ***not*** intended to be:
 - A package manager (e.g., Cargo, pip, NPM).
 - A meta build system or project generator (e.g., CMake, Premake).
 - Used directly by a human. Input for Button should be generated by another
   program.

## Goals

 - Be a library that package managers can use to build projects.
 - Be a target for meta build systems.
 - Be fast, correct, and useful.

## The Future

This project is a work in progress. It's too early to add documentation or any
more info to this README.
